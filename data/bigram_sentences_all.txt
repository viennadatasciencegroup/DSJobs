mixed signal verification be a big part of modern microchip development
split of the verification into a pre and post silicon show a dramatically increase of the presilicon verification part over last year
main reason for this be the increase of microchip production cost especially for submicron technology
within a presilicon verification the design be stress and test under different condition
therefore various simulation run be setup in a so call regression environment
target of this work would be to support the presilicon verification team in term of programming and scripting task for further automation of regression environment and data post processing

to predict the reliability of power semiconductor device statistical lifetime model be use that describe component aging as a function of thermomechanical stress
the observed failure distribution in cyclic load test consist of the scattering of the damage process and the scattering of the applied load
this relationship can be model with bivariate distribution function
the challenge be that the influence variable do not follow the same underlying distribution since the lifetime model be non linear and in addition censor datum have to be take into account
there be no analytic solution for this combination so the distribution must be calculate numerically

-PRON- will develop a new methodology for fault injection in systemc product level modelling of automotive iso26262 compliant magnetic sensor
product level modelling be generally use in the in different phase of modern electronic product development in order to improve the design and verification quality as well as the time to market of the product
most of automotive electronic device have nowadays to be compliant with iso26262 standard as far as functional safety be concern
this imply the necessity of reliable functional safety analysis with proper evidence of the diagnostic coverage
product level modelling can be exploit in this context as a tool for analyze the product level effect of internal fault include safety measure ability to detect the fault
-PRON- responsibility understand state of the art for fault injection relate to functional safety for automotive electronic device
