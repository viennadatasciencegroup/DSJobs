Master Thesis: Analysis of bi-variable life models for power semiconductor devices. At a glance. The KAI Competence Center for Automotive and Industrial Electronics is located in the Technology Park Villach. We research and develop for Infineon Technologies Austria, working closely with universities and colleges. To assist the KAI demotion modeling team in analyzing the reliability of power semiconductor devices, we are looking for a student to analyze bi-variable lifetime models for power semiconductor devices. Tooltip. Location Villach. Entry level thesis. Job ID 25001. Start now. Kind of full time. Limited duration. Job Description. For predicting the reliability of power semiconductor devices, statistical lifetime models are used that describe component aging as a function of thermo-mechanical stress. The observed failure distribution in cyclic load tests consists of the scattering of the damage process and the scattering of the applied load. This relationship can be modeled with bi-variant distribution functions. The challenges are that the influencing variables do not follow the same underlying distribution, since the lifetime model is non-linear and, in addition, censored data has to be taken into account. There is no analytic solution for this combination, so the distributions must be calculated numerically. In this master thesis, efficient solution algorithms for the parameter estimation of the bi-variable lifetime model are to be investigated and tested for their sensitivity. The work is supported and supervised locally by the KAI experts in the field of statistics and modeling of life. Her responsibilities include: Understanding state-of-the-art life modeling. Literature research on efficient numerical methods for the parameter estimation of bi-variate distributions. Sensitivity analysis of the lifetime model and the solution algorithm.
